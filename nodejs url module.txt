The Built-in URL Module
The URL module splits up a web address into readable parts.

To include the URL module, use the require() method:

var url = require('url');
Parse an address with the url.parse() method, and it will return a URL object with each part of the address as properties:

Example
Split a web address into readable parts:

var url = require('url');
var adr = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2017&month=february';
var q = url.parse(adr, true);

console.log(q.host); //returns 'localhost:8080'
console.log(q.pathname); //returns '/default.htm'
console.log(q.search); //returns '?year=2017&month=february'

var qdata = q.query; //returns an object: { year: 2017, month: 'february' }
console.log(qdata.month); //returns 'february'
Node.js File Server
Now we know how to parse the query string, and in the previous chapter we learned how to make Node.js behave as a file server. Let us combine the two, and serve the file requested by the client.

Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.

summer.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Summer</h1>
<p>I love the sun!</p>
</body>
</html>
winter.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Winter</h1>
<p>I love the snow!</p>
